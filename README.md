GitHub repository for [Scrape all Google Scholar Profile, Author Results to CSV with Python and SerpApi](url) blog post. _Link will be soon active_.

Code snippet from `scrape_google_scholar_profile_author_results_to_csv.py` shows how to parse all Profile results based on a given query as well as Author results by passing passed `author_id` results when scraping Author results. 

Sounds confusing? Have a look at [actual code snippet examplanation from the blog post](url) (_link will be soon_) or [look in the GitHub code snippet](https://github.com/dimitryzub/py-scrape-google-scholar-profile-author-to-csv/commit/e07f251fbf155b42d562ee05c2ff62454de1653a#diff-3c17ea7a2c35c21ee2b5ea9b9cedcd40cd8d916aca0b6ba9fda86370cf37cf99R141-R151) :-)
